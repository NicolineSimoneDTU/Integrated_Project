# Integrated Energy Grids: Modeling the Finnish Energy System

This repository contains the code, data, and results for the final project in the course **46770 Integrated Energy Grids** at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The project uses the [PyPSA](https://pypsa.org/) framework to model and optimize the Finnish energy system for the year 2015. It begins with a single-node electricity model and progressively expands to include:
- Sector coupling with heating,
- Interconnections with Sweden and Estonia,
- COâ‚‚ emissions constraints,
- Storage technologies,
- Interannual weather variability, and
- A political scenario on wind deployment limits.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- [PyPSA](https://pypsa.org/)  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy  
- Gurobi (academic license required)

## ðŸ‘¥ Authors
